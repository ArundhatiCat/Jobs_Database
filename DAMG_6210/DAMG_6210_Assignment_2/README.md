# Assignment Two - Scraping Twitter


This should be done with your group.
In this assignment, you need to database tweets related to your database project.  Each person needs to come up with 5 non-trivial questions related to both your subject and using Twitter data.  You must implement the data and queries in SQL and create a diagram representing the relationships in your database. 
You must write a robot that scraps Twitter for your data. Students in single-member groups can find other students in single-member groups to work on the Twitter data aspect of this assignment.

Design Requirements
Your submission must include:
•	Updated ER diagrams that illustrate the entire conceptual model. You need to either: incorporate the feedback you are given or respond as to why it isn’t needed.
•	SQL and diagram for the physical model that represents the entire conceptual/physical
•	Relational algebra expressions that express the queries you are asked to write. (If a query can’t be asked using relational algebra then explain why?)
•	SQL that expresses the queries you are asked to write.
•	At least 5 use cases of queries that are particular to your domain.
•	Relational algebra expressions that express the 5 use cases of queries that you write.
•	SQL expressions that express the 5 use cases of queries that you write.
•	A bot the scraps Twitter

Queries (25 points)
Note: You may have to update your database model that makes these queries.
Queries you must answer about your physical model (In Relational algebra & SQL):
1.	What user posted this tweet?
2.	When did the user post this tweet?
3.	What tweets have this user posted in the past 24 hours?
4.	How many tweets have this user posted in the past 24 hours?
5.	When did this user join Twitter?
6.	What keywords/ hashtags are popular?
7.	What tweets are popular?

Use Cases
At least 5 use cases (per group member) of queries that are particular to your domain. This means your use cases cannot be queries that are general to Twitter as above. If your use cases can be applied to everyone’s model then they are not particular to your domain (e.g. Games, Film, Databases, Cartoons, Baseball, Pokemon, Music, etc.). The 5 use cases must involve tables/entities that are domain specific. At least two use cases of queries must involve the Twitter tables with the domain-specific tables.
If you are working in a group on the same model, each student must come up with 5 different use cases.

Twitter Account
You need a Twitter account ( https://twitter.com/signup Links to an external site. ). It is recommended that you create a Twitter account separate from your personal one for this class as it will be used for interacting with the Twitter API (https://dev.twitter.com/ Links to an external site. )
