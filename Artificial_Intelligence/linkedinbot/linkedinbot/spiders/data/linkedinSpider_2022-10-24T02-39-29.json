These systems already impact many aspects of our lives and will continue to grow in their influence over the next two decades. Therefore, ensuring the reliability, safety, security, fairness, and understandability of these systems is critical. To date, tools to ensure that AI-powered systems meet these standards have lagged behind the tools used to develop them. This has led to two common outcomes: deployment of AI-powered systems without proper verification and validation, or conversely, failure to deploy a system after costly development time and resources due to a lack of trust in the system by stakeholders. This is where CalypsoAI comes in. We are building a suite of products and tools to facilitate the deployment of trustworthy AI by focusing on rigorous verification and validation testing. We are looking for a Data Scientist to join our growing team.

We build software that helps people do what  only  they can do \u2013  give meaning Data fills our modern world. It flows prolifically inside organizations, customer interactions, through product usage, environmental research, healthcare imaging, and beyond. What if we could use any of that historical data to predict the future? The fact is, in most cases we can make predictions through Machine Learning and AI, but to do so in a meaningful and impactful way, historical data needs to be accurate, comprehensive, and absent of bias. In order to make the best predictions, we believe internal teams with domain expertise should be responsible for annotating and curating data. It's called data labeling, and it's a process of real people giving meaning to the information they see on the screen. Heartex was founded to take data labeling to the next level. We believe that data labeling is a team sport. Data scientists, subject matter experts, engineers, operations, and annotators must work collaboratively to ensure quality results and an efficient process. That's why we created Label Studio, which has quickly become the most popular open source data labeling platform with 1000,000 users around the world, alongside a community of thousands of data scientists sharing knowledge and working to advance data-centric AI. We are excited to announce that Heartex has recently raised  $25 million  in  Series A  funding, bringing our total funds raised to $30 million from notable investment partners Redpoint Ventures, Unusual Ventures, Bow Capital, Swift Ventures, as well as angel investors.

Here's an assortment of some recent projects, to give you a taste of what we work on these days: Data analytics tools that let organization leaders support inclusion and quickly pinpoint what matters most for their teams Letting a team pick which skills they most want to develop together Internationalization infrastructure to make sure people across the globe can all benefit from the Humu product Migrating between backends for our privacy-aware database layer, without breaking all of the application code that sits on top (we don't have a blog post about this one) Humu was founded in 2017; this year we raised a $60M Series C round and we're excited to grow our ~100-person company and ~20-person engineering team. We started with an office in Mountain View, CA; we still have that office, but we've since hired many engineers across the US and plan to continue supporting a remote-first culture. You may have heard of a couple of our leaders. Sophie Alpert heads our engineering team and used to lead the React team at Facebook. Laszlo Bock, who's famous for creating Google's innovative culture as their head of HR, is our CEO and co-founder. We have some other really cool people too. At Humu, we're incredibly proud of the people-first culture we've built and the work we do to sustain it. \"Everybody deserves a great manager\" isn't just a product motto; it's a part of our culture. You'll be working with somebody who actually cares about you as a human being (as well as about helping your career develop).  We genuinely care about diversity. Half of our engineering leaders are women; 20% of our executive team are Black. But we don't think that diversity is a checkbox or just something to write on our website, and we're always striving to get better. If you have a different background from most of the tech industry, we would especially love to meet you.  We've invested in a super supportive onboarding process. When we asked our team for a quote to write here, the first response was: \"The absolute best onboarding experience I have ever gone through! Onboarding takes a lot of effort to do smoothly, so the amount of planning, care, and thoughtfulness was super apparent to me. It exceeded my expectations every step of the way and really helped me get familiar with the different teams at Humu and hit the ground running.\" We work sustainably, and we're taking every other Friday off through the end of 2022 to help people spend time on what matters most to them.  If this sounds like the type of company you'd like to be a part of building, we'd love to hear from you so that we can tell you more.\n       \n \n        Show more\n\n         \n \n \n        Show less", "seniorityLevel": "Entry level", "employmentType": "Full-time", "jobFunction": "Engineering and Information Technology", "industry": "Human Resources Services"},

Past features we've launched include Navigate on Autopilot (making lane changes and taking highway exits), Smart Summon (calling the Tesla to you in a parking lot without anyone in the vehicle), Stopping for Stop Signs and Traffic Lights, Radar Removal, and more than a dozen active safety features. Currently, we are working to release the Full-Self-Driving feature on city streets. To achieve this, the team actively collects massive datasets from the customer fleet, creates ground truth of labeled videos, and deploys deep neural networks to our fleet of more than two million Tesla cars. As Data Project Manager, you will run the \"data engine,\" the process by which we improve neural networks via data annotation by leveraging Tesla's fleet. You will take ownership of the datasets of specific vision models (ex. stop signs) and make them large, high quality, and diverse. You will identify areas where neural networks are challenged (ex. even blue stop signs!), work with engineers to formalize requirements and deliverables for the data annotation team, and close the loop by driving improvements in models via data. You will manage the variety of datasets (what should get annotated), the ontology (how data should be labeled), and close the loop on the project's impact on improving Autopilot performance and reducing interventions (why data is labeled). The data engine is the most crucial aspect of \"pre-neural-network\" development and has unlocked every major Autopilot customer release.

Detail-oriented - You\u2019ll be taking ownership of engineering in an intentional and fast-moving team where attention to detail and perseverance are important.  Our Head of Engineering will be given a clear, goal-oriented career path towards a VP or CTO level role as the company grows. Skillfully is currently a seed stage company, and as such, this role comes with a competitive salary and equity package. For those candidates invited to meet the Skillful.ly team for an interview we\u2019ll be happy to provide more information about our interview structure and expectations of candidate time commitment. Overview Skillful.ly is a new type of employment platform that connects job seekers with professional opportunities based entirely on the merits of their demonstrated skills. We started Skillful.ly to provide our users a more equitable alternative to traditional resume-driven hiring, allowing them to be seen for how well they use their skills rather than just where they may have learned them. Our home is in San Francisco but we operate on a national scale. We are a seed-funded, post-product, post-revenue startup, working with multiple Fortune 100 enterprise customers. We\u2019re a deeply mission-driven team looking for great people who have a big vision for reshaping employment, higher education and access to opportunity. Our Business Skillful.ly is an online employment marketplace that shifts focus away from outdated paper credentials towards a more flexible, fair and representative unit of qualification: validated skill proficiency. We assess a user\u2019s proficiency across a wide range of job skills and use that data to guide their future development and match them to jobs they\u2019re qualified for. For job seekers, our platform provides a forum to develop and demonstrate their professional skill set. Users build their profiles by completing virtual simulations of real workplace challenges, which are sourced directly from our employer customers. Users experience what it means to work in various career paths and get the chance to be recognized for their real professional potential, not just the pedigree of their background. For employers, our tools enable recruiters to engage a far broader pool of highly-skilled, pre-qualified candidates than traditional tools allow. Employers come to Skillful.ly to follow a more equitable and efficient form of recruitment, and to meet candidates who would have likely gone unrecognized through other hiring channels. Our Platform Our platform is our interface between our users, partners, and employer customers. Building a strong, brilliant and ethical engineering foundation is an early requirement we prioritize highly. Intelligent adaptive learning solutions, neurocognitive assessment technology, and machine learning applications all play a critical role in revealing the unique cognitive abilities, behavioral attributes and intrinsic potential of our users and how we match them with employers. Our Mission Skillful.ly is a registered Public Benefit Corporation (PBC) incorporated to improve what we believe is a deeply broken system connecting higher education with employment. We consider our social mission of building a more equitable employment alternative to be just as important as our financial goals to build a successful, scalable business. We value mission-alignment in new team members and enthusiastically seek out those who are passionate about our work. Technology The platform is currently built using NodeJS w/ Typescript, Angular, Postgres, and relies on the AWS ecosystem for hosting (Lambda, Terraform, DynamoDB, etc). Data privacy and protection is an important part of the Skillfully DNA (as you can see in our Core Values), and every decision is made with the users' sensitive data in mind. Being selective about the data that is shared with employers also helps Skillfully fulfill its promise of fairly and equitably representing the interests of our Learners in sensitive employment conversations.\n       \n \n        Show more\n\n         \n \n \n        Show less", "seniorityLevel": "Executive", "employmentType": "Full-time", "jobFunction": "Engineering and Information Technology", "industry": "IT Services and IT Consulting"},

Overview Skillful.ly is a new type of employment platform that connects job seekers with professional opportunities based entirely on the merits of their demonstrated skills. We started Skillful.ly to provide our users a more equitable alternative to traditional resume-driven hiring, allowing them to be seen for how well they use their skills rather than just where they may have learned them. Our home is in San Francisco but we operate on a national scale. We are a seed-funded, post-product, post-revenue startup, working with multiple Fortune 100 enterprise customers. We\u2019re a deeply mission-driven team looking for great people who have a big vision for reshaping employment, higher education and access to opportunity. Our Business Skillful.ly is an online employment marketplace that shifts focus away from outdated paper credentials towards a more flexible, fair and representative unit of qualification: validated skill proficiency. We assess a user\u2019s proficiency across a wide range of job skills and use that data to guide their future development and match them to jobs they\u2019re qualified for. For job seekers, our platform provides a forum to develop and demonstrate their professional skill set. Users build their profiles by completing virtual simulations of real workplace challenges, which are sourced directly from our employer customers. Users experience what it means to work in various career paths and get the chance to be recognized for their real professional potential, not just the pedigree of their background. For employers, our tools enable recruiters to engage a far broader pool of highly-skilled, pre-qualified candidates than traditional tools allow. Employers come to Skillful.ly to follow a more equitable and efficient form of recruitment, and to meet candidates who would have likely gone unrecognized through other hiring channels. Our Platform Our platform is our interface between our users, partners, and employer customers. Building a strong, brilliant and ethical engineering foundation is an early requirement we prioritize highly. Intelligent adaptive learning solutions, neurocognitive assessment technology, and machine learning applications all play a critical role in revealing the unique cognitive abilities, behavioral attributes and intrinsic potential of our users and how we match them with employers. Our Mission Skillful.ly is a registered Public Benefit Corporation (PBC) incorporated to improve what we believe is a deeply broken system connecting higher education with employment. We consider our social mission of building a more equitable employment alternative to be just as important as our financial goals to build a successful, scalable business. We value mission-alignment in new team members and enthusiastically seek out those who are passionate about our work. Technology The platform is currently built using NodeJS w/ Typescript, Angular, Postgres, and relies on the AWS ecosystem for hosting (Lambda, Terraform, DynamoDB, etc). Data privacy and protection is an important part of the Skillfully DNA (as you can see in our Core Values), and every decision is made with the users' sensitive data in mind. Being selective about the data that is shared with employers also helps Skillfully fulfill its promise of fairly and equitably representing the interests of our Learners in sensitive employment conversations.\n       \n \n        Show more\n\n         \n \n \n        Show less", "seniorityLevel": "Executive", "employmentType": "Full-time", "jobFunction": "Engineering and Information Technology", "industry": "IT Services and IT Consulting"},

The project manager\u2019s first role is to make a feasible plan that achieves the goals and objectives of the project and aligns with the organization\u2019s overall business strategy. This involves creating a project schedule, securing the resources, defining the project goals, among many other things. Assembling And Leading a Project Team Project managers need resources to complete the project tasks, which include skilled and experienced team members. A project manager either takes a leadership role with an existing project team or creates one. Once a team is created, you need to create a project schedule to assign them tasks and deadlines, give them the tools to collaborate and don\u2019t get in their way by micromanaging every activity. Meet regularly, of course, and get status updates to chart their progress while reallocating resources as needed to avoid blocking team members or overburdening them. Time Management Time is always ticking towards the project deadline. While communication is key to addressing changes and making sure everyone is doing what they need to do, the project manager must also define, schedule and accurately estimate the task duration to develop and maintain a realistic project schedule. Resource Management Nothing is going to get done without money. Figuring out what the proper funding for the project is, having that get accepted and then keeping the project within or under budget is often what makes or breaks a project. You can get your stakeholder their deliverables on time, but if that cost more than the budget you created, then the project is a failure. Stakeholder Management You want to deliver to your stakeholders what they expected or better and make sure that they\u2019re satisfied with the results. But that doesn\u2019t mean ignoring them to focus solely on the project. Rather, you need to be in constant communication with them, reporting on progress and being open to their feedback to keep them happy and coming back to you with future projects. Risk Management Problems will inevitably arise in a project. That\u2019s called an issue. You need to be ready for them and work towards resolving them quickly, so they don\u2019t take your project off track. Then there are risks, which are potential problems, ones that have yet to occur or might not ever. Regardless, you must figure out beforehand what the risks are and set in place a plan of action if they in fact occur. Monitoring Progress To make sure a project is progressing as planned, you must constantly measure it and compare those metrics against the plan you created. Therefore, you must have a way to collect project data, such as status reports from your team, to see if the actual progress of the project is meeting what you had initially planned. Reporting And Documentation Reporting is one of the ways you communicate with your team and stakeholders. While teams need more detailed information and stakeholders are looking for broader data to check the project\u2019s progress, both are essential tasks for the project manager. This documentation, along with all paperwork, must be collected, signed off on and archived by the end of a project, which provides a history that you can revisit when planning for a similar project in the future.

It is an ambitious  vision  that will require the development of products and solutions at the cutting edge of  machine   learning  and AI. If that excites you, we'd love to chat. The AIML Sequence  Learning  Team applies  machine   learning  and AI methods to DNA and RNA sequence  data  from large-scale human genetic, functional  genomic  and single  cell  experiments. DNA sequence variations are linked to disease via changes in the nature and abundance of protein and RNA gene products. The Sequence  Learning  group builds models directly from DNA/RNA sequence in addition to other  data  sources such as chromatin state. Models that operate on a sequence level can infer changes in protein/RNA states and the associated cellular function from sequence alone.

Launched in February 2021, Jasper is an AI content platform that helps creators and companies of all types expand their creative potential. More than 77,000 customers use Jasper to break through writer's block, repackage their content, create original art, and adjust writing for language and tone. We are at the forefront of teaching the world how to leverage artificial intelligence as a creative partner and growing a team that will pioneer the space even further. About The Role As a  Product Support Specialist based at our Corporate HQ in Austin, TX  you are responsible for supporting users' technical needs, ensuring their successful onboarding, and use of Jasper and all our integrations. Product Support Specialists are responsible for post-sales technical support for clients and assisting them in proactive and reactive ways. The Product Support Specialist should help customers evaluate solution implementation, understand how to utilize it, integrate it into their existing systems, and successfully deploy and troubleshoot any issues with it. Our teams are passionate about supporting new employees and growing a divers culture of ideas and collaboration. Our work is about using artificial intelligence to unlock creative potential. We see AI as a partner to creatives that can get them through writer's block, over hurdles and out of the content hamster wheel. Ai should empower content creators to do their best work and get time and mental space back for new ideas. Our target market is composed of creatives (writers, designers, content marketers) and content-forward companies. The role is open to candidates  located in Austin, TX.  This role is  hybrid  and will require you to be in the Austin office  a few days per week . We have built a strong foundation to support hybrid employees growth and engagement with other teams. What You Will Do At Jasper As the front line of support, you will identify the pain points, trends, and issues that our users and customers face. Most importantly, you will resolve those issues by directly fixing problems and by working together with the Customer Success, Sales, Engineering, and Product teams. Aspects of this role will involve a certain degree of investigation and education, as people don't always use products as intended, and products don't always do what they're supposed to do.

We're hiring software engineers! We're looking for generalist engineers with  2+ years of experience working on an engineering team . Most of our work is web app development, but we also have lots of data/AI and infrastructure work to do. We build on top of Python, Google Cloud, TypeScript, React, and GraphQL, but you don't need to know those already; if you've used similar tools in the past then you can definitely learn these too. Strong technical skills are certainly important to us \u2013 we want people who are comfortable coding and can learn new things quickly \u2013 but we care just as much about your ability to collaborate well, not only with your fellow engineers but also across our many important functions, including design, PM, science, and our customer-facing teams. (We're not interested in hiring \"brilliant jerks\".) We love people from all sorts of different backgrounds! Whether you're someone who has been leading software projects for years, a bootcamp alum who has been in the software industry for a couple years, or anything in between, we want to hear from you. You might be wondering what it is we actually do here.  At Humu, our mission is to make work better, because we all spend SO MUCH time at work and many people don't have a job they love. Everything we do is grounded in science, and we believe it's possible to create team cultures in which every employee feels valued, heard, and empowered to succeed. This year, we're really focused on building tools to help managers be better coaches, because we believe everybody deserves a great manager. Here's an assortment of some recent projects, to give you a taste of what we work on these days: Data analytics tools that let organization leaders support inclusion and quickly pinpoint what matters most for their teams Letting a team pick which skills they most want to develop together Internationalization infrastructure to make sure people across the globe can all benefit from the Humu product Migrating between backends for our privacy-aware database layer, without breaking all of the application code that sits on top (we don't have a blog post about this one) Humu was founded in 2017; this year we raised a $60M Series C round and we're excited to grow our ~100-person company and ~20-person engineering team. We started with an office in Mountain View, CA; we still have that office, but we've since hired many engineers across the US and plan to continue supporting a remote-first culture. You may have heard of a couple of our leaders. Sophie Alpert heads our engineering team and used to lead the React team at Facebook. Laszlo Bock, who's famous for creating Google's innovative culture as their head of HR, is our CEO and co-founder. We have some other really cool people too. At Humu, we're incredibly proud of the people-first culture we've built and the work we do to sustain it. \"Everybody deserves a great manager\" isn't just a product motto; it's a part of our culture. You'll be working with somebody who actually cares about you as a human being (as well as about helping your career develop).  We genuinely care about diversity. Half of our engineering leaders are women; 20% of our executive team are Black. But we don't think that diversity is a checkbox or just something to write on our website, and we're always striving to get better. If you have a different background from most of the tech industry, we would especially love to meet you.  We've invested in a super supportive onboarding process. When we asked our team for a quote to write here, the first response was: \"The absolute best onboarding experience I have ever gone through! Onboarding takes a lot of effort to do smoothly, so the amount of planning, care, and thoughtfulness was super apparent to me. It exceeded my expectations every step of the way and really helped me get familiar with the different teams at Humu and hit the ground running.\" We work sustainably, and we're taking every other Friday off through the end of 2022 to help people spend time on what matters most to them.
