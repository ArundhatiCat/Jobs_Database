* Quick ratio =Cash +Marketable securities +Accounts receivableCurrent liabilities    
* Cash ratio =Cash and cash equivalentsCurrent liabilities    
* Operating cash flow ratio = Cash flow from operationscurrent liabilities    
* Total Debt Ratio = Total assets –Total stockholders’ equityTotal assets

* Interest coverage ratio=EBITInterest expense    
* Inventory Turnover = Cost of Goods Sold / Inventory

## Time Value of Money    
* Future value: 𝐹𝑉 = 𝑃𝑉×(1 + 𝑟)𝑇    
* Present value: 𝑃𝑉=𝐹𝑉(1+𝑟)𝑇    
* Net present value: 𝑁𝑃𝑉=𝐶0+Σ𝐶𝑡(1+𝑟)𝑡𝑇𝑡=1    
* The internal rate of return (IRR) has to satisfy the following equation:    
0=𝐶0+𝐶11+𝐼𝑅𝑅+𝐶2(1+𝐼𝑅𝑅)2+𝐶3(1+𝐼𝑅𝑅)3+⋯+𝐶𝑇(1+𝐼𝑅𝑅)𝑇    
* Effective annual rate: 𝐸𝐴𝑅=(1+𝑟𝑚)𝑚−1    
* Future value based on continuous compounding: 𝐹𝑉=𝑃𝑉×𝑒𝑟𝑇    
* Perpetuity: 𝑃𝑉=𝐶𝑟    
* Growing perpetuity: 𝑃𝑉=𝐶𝑟−𝑔    
* Annuity: 𝑃𝑉=𝐶𝑟[1−1(1+𝑟)𝑡]    
* Growing annuity: 𝑃𝑉=𝐶𝑟−𝑔[1−(1+𝑔1+𝑟)𝑡]
